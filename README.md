Welcome to lights out, a REACT game build by Megan List.

To test the game locally, run:

yarn install

to setup the local runtime environment, then run:

yarn start

to run the app.

Done:
* Display Grid
* elevate state of squares
* change color of individual squares
* change colors of adjacent squares
* determine winners

TODO:
* add additional containers and style
* add turn counter
* make board size mutable (harder/easier games)
